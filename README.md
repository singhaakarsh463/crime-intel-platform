# Crime Intelligence Platform — Production & Complete 10-Pillar Build

A complete, enterprise-grade law enforcement case management and AI intelligence platform aligned with the **official Karnataka State Police (KSP) FIR ER Diagram**, built with **FastAPI**, **SQLite/PostgreSQL**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **D3.js**, and **Recharts**.

## 🚀 Problem Statement 10-Pillar Feature Mapping (100% Coverage)

| Pillar # | Problem Statement Requirement | CrimeIntel Implemented Feature & Route |
|---|---|---|
| **Pillar 1** | Case Management & Search | Multi-attribute filtering, free-text search, paginated cases (`/cases`), and structured KSP FIR details. |
| **Pillar 2** | AI Case Assistant | **Full-Page AI Research Desk** (`/assistant`) + Floating Widget (`ChatWidget.jsx`), shared session state, deep-search RAG, bilingual (English + Kannada), Web Speech API voice I/O, PDF export, and **Explainable AI Reasoning Steps**. |
| **Pillar 3** | Hotspot Map | Spatial visualization with Leaflet, dark ops-room basemap, and severity-coded incident markers (`/map`). |
| **Pillar 4** | Criminal Network Visualization | Force-directed D3 graph (`/network`), recurring phone link edges, and **Organized Crime / Gang Group Detection** (`/api/network/groups`). |
| **Pillar 5** | Predictive Analytics & Trend Alerts | District incident trend comparison (30-day delta heuristics), high-severity alert feeds on `/dashboard`, and **Seasonal/Event-based trend analysis** on `/insights`. |
| **Pillar 6** | Audit Trail & RBAC | Role-based access control (`investigator`, `analyst`, `admin`, `viewer`), full action logs (`/audit`), and statutory sensitive field redaction. |
| **Pillar 7** | Production Hardening | Docker Compose orchestration (Postgres 16 + FastAPI + Nginx), rate limiting via `slowapi`, Admin User Management UI (`/admin`), and CSV bulk case import (`/import`). |
| **Pillar 8** | Offender Profiling & Risk Scoring | Non-biased behavioral risk scoring (0–100 scale), MO pattern repetition tracking, and offender profile directory (`/offenders`). |
| **Pillar 9** | Socio-Demographic Crime Insights | Aggregate demographic distributions (age, gender, urban/rural), district socioeconomic correlations, and **Seasonal/Event-based trend charts** (`/insights`). |
| **Pillar 10** | Financial Crime Linking | Bank account mapping, transaction flow graph (`/finance/trail/{case_id}`), and flagged monetary movement overlays on the network graph. |

## ⚖️ Non-Biased Risk Scoring Model

Offender risk scores are strictly **behavioral and criminological** (case volume, max severity, recency, MO repetition, and network centrality). 
**Demographic attributes (age, gender, income, education, area) are strictly excluded from individual risk scoring.**
For full mathematical formulas and fairness guarantees, see [RISK_SCORING.md](file:///d:/Projects/bihari_datathon/crime-intel-platform/RISK_SCORING.md).

---

## 🕸️ Organized Crime & Gang Group Detection

CrimeIntel automatically detects potential criminal syndicates using a multi-vector connected-components clustering algorithm on persons with $\ge 2$ link types (co-accused, shared phone number, or shared financial transfers).
For full clustering thresholds and group risk formulas, see [GROUP_DETECTION.md](file:///d:/Projects/bihari_datathon/crime-intel-platform/GROUP_DETECTION.md).

## 🤖 Full-Page AI Assistant (`/assistant`)

In addition to the floating bottom-right `ChatWidget.jsx`, CrimeIntel features a dedicated 3-column **AI Assistant Desk** at `/assistant`:
- **Left Column:** Saved Investigative Threads session list & "+ New Conversation" button.
- **Center Column:** Full-height thread, bilingual language toggle (EN/Kannada), speech-to-text mic, read-aloud toggle, and **"⬇ Export PDF Report"** transcript generator.
- **Right Column:** Real-time **Execution Reasoning Steps** and **Source Case Citations** with similarity scores and direct links (`[Open Case File ➔]`).
- **Shared Session State:** Conversations seamlessly synchronize between the floating widget and full page using shared `localStorage` session keying.

## 🔒 Statutory Compliance & Sensitive Data Protocol

> **Notice:** `religion_id` and `caste_id` on Complainant records are mandated by the official KSP FIR schema, but are strictly access-restricted in CrimeIntel for anti-discrimination compliance. These fields are:
> - **Excluded** from AI RAG index, analytics, risk scoring, and network graph computations.
> - **Masked** as `null` for non-admin roles at the API layer.
> - **Logged** to `audit_logs` (`action="view_sensitive_complainant_data"`) whenever read by an Admin user.

## 📢 Synthetic Demo Data Disclosure

> **Notice:** All socio-demographic statistics, district indicators, bank accounts, financial transactions, and FIR records seeded in this demo environment are **synthetic data** generated exclusively for technical evaluation and policy insight demonstration.
